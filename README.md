CloudNine Photography
Welcome to CloudNine Photography, a sophisticated and visually engaging website designed to showcase our photography portfolio, services, and connect with our audience. This project leverages modern web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices.

Design Choices
Responsive Design: Utilizing CSS media queries, the website is fully responsive, offering an optimal viewing experience from desktops to mobile devices.
Visual Aesthetics: The choice of a monochrome color scheme with blue accents creates a professional yet inviting atmosphere, allowing the photography to stand out.
Typography: We selected 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif as our font stack for its readability and modern appearance.
CSS Animations: Simple animations such as fade-ins for images and hover effects for buttons enhance user interaction without distracting from the main content.
Bootstrap Framework: Bootstrap's grid system and components (like the carousel) were used to expedite development while ensuring consistency and responsiveness.
